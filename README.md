# AI_PLA_Regression_and_Classification
Implementation of Preception Learning Algorithm (PLA), Linear Regression and Classification

There are three parts to this implementation. 

  I. Perceptron Learning Algorithm - PLA (problem1)

  II. Linear Regression (problem2)

  III. Classification (problem3)
    •	SVM with Linear Kernel.
    •	SVM with Polynomial Kernel. 
    •	SVM with RBF Kernel. 
    •	Logistic Regression. 
    •	k-Nearest Neighbors. 
    •	Decision Trees. 
    •	Random Forest. 

To run the program use the following command:

$ python3 problemX.py inputX.csv outputX.csv
where X is the number of problem to execute.
